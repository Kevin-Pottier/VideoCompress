# VideoCompress

Modern, user-friendly Python GUI for compressing one or multiple video files and translating subtitles, with per-file progress, ETA, and advanced batch features.

## Features
- Unified video compression: select one or multiple videos, all in one workflow.
- Batch mode: see all progress bars in a scrollable window, with per-file ETA.
- Modern UI: clean, dark-themed interface, clear fonts, colors, and spacing.
- Subtitle handling: for each video, choose to ignore, softcode, or hardcode subtitles.
- Efficient batch subtitle workflow: first select which videos need subtitles, then only configure those.
- Subtitle translation: translate .srt files between languages with progress feedback.
- Robust error handling and user feedback throughout.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- FFmpeg and FFprobe installed and available in your system PATH
- Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
  - `colorama` (for colored terminal output)
  - `pysrt` (for reading/writing subtitle files)
  - `deep-translator` (for Google Translate API)
  - `tkinter` (standard library)

## Usage
1. Install requirements:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Install FFmpeg and make sure it is in your system PATH.
3. Run the app:
   `python main.py`
4. Choose a mode:
   - Video Compression: Select one or more videos, configure subtitles, output format, and size.
   - Subtitle Translation: Translate a subtitle file between languages.

## Major Changes
- Unified single and batch video compression into one workflow.
- Modernized all GUIs (fonts, colors, spacing, centering).
- Added scrollable progress window for batch compression.
- Improved subtitle workflow: select which videos need subtitles before configuring options.
- Per-file progress bars and ETA in batch mode.
- Robust error handling and user feedback throughout.

## Making an .exe out of this code
You can have a .exe out of this script to make it easier to access and share to your friends. 
1. To do so, you first need to install `pyinstaller`
```bash 
pip install pyinstaller
```
2. You can just run the following command: 
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile CompressMovie.py
```

## Changelog

### July 2025
- Subtitle translation workflow now fully implemented:
  - Uses Google Translate (deep-translator) to translate all lines from English to French.
  - Fast, multi-threaded translation for speed.
  - Real-time progress bar in the command line.
  - Output saved as `_translated.srt`.
- Requirements updated: now uses `colorama`, `pysrt`, and `deep-translator`.
- `.gitignore` and documentation updated to reflect new modular structure and ignored files.

## Troubleshooting

- Only third-party packages (like `colorama`) are listed in `requirements.txt`. Standard Python libraries such as `os`, `subprocess`, and `tkinter` are included with every Python installation and do not need to be installed separately. If you encounter errors about missing standard libraries, your Python installation may be brokenâ€”reinstall Python from the official website to fix this.
