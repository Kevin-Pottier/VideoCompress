# CompressMovie

> This repository now uses a modular Python project structure for video compression and subtitle translation using FFmpeg.

## Features
- Modular codebase: main logic is split into `main.py`, `gui_film.py`, `gui_subtitle.py`, `compression.py`, and `utils.py`.
- Choose usage mode at launch: Film Compression or Subtitle Translation (via a GUI dialog).
- For Film Compression:
  - Select a video file via a GUI dialog (supports .mp4, .mkv, .avi)
  - Choose subtitle options via a dedicated dialog: no subtitles, softcode (attach .srt), or hardcode (burn in). If you select a subtitle option but do not choose a file, you will be prompted again.
  - Choose output container (MP4 or MKV) via a dialog
  - Enter the maximum output file size (in GB) via a dialog
  - Uses relative subtitle paths for better FFmpeg compatibility
  - Automatically calculates the required video bitrate for your target size
  - Runs FFmpeg directly (no batch file needed)
  - Shows the FFmpeg command used
- For Subtitle Translation:
  - Select a subtitle file to translate via a dialog
  - (Translation logic placeholder: currently just prints the selected file)

## Requirements
- Python 3
- FFmpeg and FFprobe installed and available in your system PATH
- Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`
- `colorama` (optional, for colored terminal output)

All required Python packages can be installed with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   `python main.py`
2. Choose the usage mode:
   - **Film Compression**: Compress a video file with optional subtitles.
   - **Subtitle Translation**: Select a subtitle file for translation (feature placeholder).
3. Follow the dialogs for your chosen mode:
   - For Film Compression:
     - Select a video file.
     - Choose subtitle options (none, softcode, hardcode). If you select softcode or hardcode, you must also select a subtitle file.
     - Choose the output container (MP4 or MKV).
     - Enter the maximum output file size (in GB).
     - The script will extract video/audio metadata, calculate the required video bitrate, and run FFmpeg to compress the video.
     - The output video will be created in the same folder as the original.
   - For Subtitle Translation:
     - Select a subtitle file. (Translation logic not yet implemented.)

- Only `.py`, `.gitignore`, `README.Md`, and `requirements.txt` are tracked by git (see `.gitignore`).
- All other files (videos, batch files, outputs, and the old `CompressMovie.py`) are ignored by git.

## Making an .exe out of this code
You can have a .exe out of this script to make it easier to access and share to your friends. 
1. To do so, you first need to install `pyinstaller`
```bash 
pip install pyinstaller
```
2. You can just run the following command: 
```bash 
pyinstaller --onefile CompressMovie.py
```

## Troubleshooting

- Only third-party packages (like `colorama`) are listed in `requirements.txt`. Standard Python libraries such as `os`, `subprocess`, and `tkinter` are included with every Python installation and do not need to be installed separately. If you encounter errors about missing standard libraries, your Python installation may be brokenâ€”reinstall Python from the official website to fix this.
